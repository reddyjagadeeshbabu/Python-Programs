#Loop Through a List
#You can loop through the list items by using a for loop:
thislist = ["banana","ornage","apple"]
for x in thislist:
    print( x )
    
   # Loop Through the Index Numbers
#You can also loop through the list items by referring to their index number.

#Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.
thislist = ["banana","ornage","apple"]
for i in range(len(thislist)):
    print(i)
